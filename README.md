# Alzheimer Early Detection – Data Mining Project

This project applies **Machine Learning techniques** to support the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease using clinical and biological data.  

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Feature extraction and selection  
- Predictive modeling using supervised learning algorithms  
- Performance evaluation with key metrics  

## Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

## Objective
The goal is to explore how data-driven models can contribute to **healthcare decision-making** and support early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.
